He was crushed by poverty, but even the anxieties of his position had recently ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. In fact, nothing that any landlady could do held any terror for him.

The unbearable stench from the taverns, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a weekday, completed the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the deepest disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon, though, he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was around him and not caring to observe it. From time to time, because he used to talk to himself, he would mutter something, a habit to which he had just confessed. At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had had almost nothing to eat.\n",

In that part of town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. Due to the proximity of the Haymarket, the number of establishments of a certain kind and the overwhelming numbers of craftsmen and workers crowded in these streets and alleys at the center of Petersburg, so many different types of people were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however strange, would have caused surprise. But there was such accumulated spite and contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in spite of all the cares of youth, he minded his rags least of all. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge cart dragged by a heavy cart-horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past, “Hey there, German hatter,” bellowing at the top of his voice and pointing at him — the young man stopped suddenly and clutched trembling at his hat. It was a tall round one from Zimmermann’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most hideous fashion. Not shame, however, but another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.\n",

He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face. The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.  He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window.  Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely. It looked normal, but it was still stinging.  harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken. It had seemed so real...There had been two people he knew and one he didn't ...He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember...  The dim picture of a darkened room came to him...There had been a snake on a hearth rug...a small man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail...and a cold, high voice...the voice of Lord Voldemort. Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought...  He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible...All Harry knew was that at the moment when Voldemort's chair had swung around, and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of  horror, which had awoken him...or had that been the pain in his scar?  And who had the old man been? For there had definitely been an old man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused. Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them...Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though Harry could not remember the name...and they had been plotting to kill someone else...him!  Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there. As it happened, there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor beside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night. The pictures in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.  Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched on of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop. Then he snapped the book shut. Even Quidditch -- in Harry's opinion, the best sport in the world -- couldn't distract him at the moment. He placed Flying with the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew back the curtains to survey the street below.  Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look inthe early hours of Saturday morning. All the curtains were closed. As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn't a living creature in sight, not even a cat.  And yet...and yet...Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn't the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been pierced by a venemous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborn broomstick. He was used to bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble.  No, the thing that was bothering Harry was the last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by...But Voldemort couldn't be here, now...The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible...  Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room.  Harry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. There was no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.  Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn't as though they were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were Harry's only living relatives. They were Muggles who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant that Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot. They had explained away Harry's long absences at Hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn't allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world. The very idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries about Voldemort, was laughable.  And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with the Dursleys in the first place. If it hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry would still have had parents...  Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort -- the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years -- arrived at his house and killed his father and mother. Voldemort had then turned his  wand on Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power -- and, incredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the curse had rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive. His powers gone, his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, Voldemort's followers had disbanded, and Harry Potter had become famous.  It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was used to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again.  But there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school. He looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of July. What would they say if Harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting?  At once, Hermione Granger's voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and panicky.  \\\\Your scar hurt? Harry, that's really serious.... Write to Professor Dumbledore!  And I'll go and check Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.... Maybe there's something in there about curse scars. . . .\\\\\\\"  Yes, that would be Hermione's advice: Go straight to the headmaster of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry stared out of the window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort's; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. As for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays. He amused himself for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full length wizard's robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose.  Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig would be able to find him; Harry's owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address.  But what would he write?  Dear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt this morning.  Yours sincerely, Harry Potter.  Even inside his head the words sounded stupid.  And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron Weasley's, reaction, and in a moment, Ron's red hair and long-nosed, freckled face seemed to swim before Harry, wearing a bemused expression.  \\\\\\\"Your scar hurt? But ... but You-Know-Who can't be near you now, can he? I mean ... you'd know, wouldn't you? He'd be trying to do you in again, wouldn't be? I dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always twinge a bit... I'll ask Dad. . . .\\\\\\\"  Mr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he didn't have any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry knew. In any case, Harry didn't like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments' pain. Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron's sixteen-year- old twin brothers, might think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys were Harry's favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn't want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.  Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like - someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience with Dark Magic....  And then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious, that he couldn't believe it had taken so long - Sirius.  Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn't thought of Sirius straight away. But then, perhaps it wasn't so  surprising - after all, he had only found out that Sirius was his godfather two months ago.  There was a simple reason for Sirius's complete absence from Harry's life until then - Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking fiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent - the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by Wormtail, Voldemort's supporter, whom nearly everybody now believed dead. Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year, though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.  For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared. But the chance had been snatched away from him - Wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life. Harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry might have had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer. It had been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever.  Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he couldn't be with him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him. The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this. But their attitude had changed since they had found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather - for Harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.  Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet Drive. Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds. Hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders; she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight, perhapse that was why Sirius had gone South. Sirius's letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under Harry's bed, sounded chearful, and in both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to right now, all right...  Harry's lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter.  Dear Sirius, Thanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it could hardly get through my window. Things are the same as usual here. Dudley's diet isn't going too well. My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him they'd have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That's a sort of computer thing you can play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn't even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind off things.  I'm okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.  A weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar hurt again. Last time that happened it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts. But I don't reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can he? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward?  I'll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she's off hunting at the moment.  Say hello to Buckbeak for me. Harry Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point putting in the dream; he didn't want it to look as though he was too worried. He folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when Hedwig returned. Then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his reflection he  started to get dressed before going down to breakfast.\\\"\",\n          \"  \\\\The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. \\\\\\\"And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can't stop them,\\\\\\\" said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, \\\\\\\"I mean to say, who can?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"That remains to be seen,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. \\\\\\\"But as all twelve of us have voted -\\\\\\\"  Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.  'An' how many did yeh have ter threaten an' blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?\\\\\\\" he roared.  \\\\\\\"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Malfoy. \\\\\\\"I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won't like it at all.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeh can' take Dumbledore!\\\\\\\" yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. \\\\\\\"Take him away, an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance! There'll be killin' next!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Calm yourself, Hagrid,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at Lucius Malfoy.  \\\\\\\"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But -\\\\\\\" stuttered Fudge.  \\\\\\\"No!\\\\\\\"growled Hagrid.  Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy's cold gray ones.  \\\\\\\"However,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, \\\\\\\"you will find that I will  * 26$*  ummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.  Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.  \\\\\\\"We're taking no more chances,\\\\\\\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \\\\\\\"No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off . . .\\\\\\\"  With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school\\u00a0that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.  Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself \\\\\\\"I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\\\\\\\" But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?  Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome.  One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.  \\\\\\\"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,\\\\\\\" he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \\\\\\\"I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever\\u00a0had. Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won't last long, she's only filling in ......  Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione's empty seat and cauldron.  \\\\\\\"Sir,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy loudly. \\\\\\\"Sir, why don't you apply for the headmaster's job?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Now, now, Malfoy,\\\\\\\" said Snape, though he couldn't suppress a thin- lipped smile. \\\\\\\"Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I daresay he'll be back with us soon enough.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Yeah, right,\\\\\\\" said Malfoy, smirking. \\\\\\\"I expect you'd have Father's vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I'll tell Father you're the best teacher here, sir -\\\\\\\"  Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron.  \\\\\\\"I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by now,\\\\\\\" Malfoy went on. \\\\\\\"Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn't Granger -\\\\\\\"  The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy's last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.  \\\\\\\"Let me at him,\\\\\\\" Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms. \\\\\\\"I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my bare hands -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology,\\\\\\\" barked Snape over the class's heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only\\u00a0safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.  The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione.  Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, \\\\\\\"I just want to say, Harry, that I'm sorry I ever suspected you. I know you'd never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We're all in the same boat now, and, well -\\\\\\\"  He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.  Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron.  \\\\\\\"That Draco Malfoy character,\\\\\\\" said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, \\\\\\\"he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he? D'you know, I think he might be Slytherin's heir.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"That's clever of you,\\\\\\\" said Ron, who didn't seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry.  \\\\\\\"Do you think it's Malfoy, Harry?\\\\\\\" Ernie asked.  \\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared.  A second later, Harry spotted something.  Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears.  \\\\\\\"Ouch! What're you -\\\\\\\"\\u00a0  Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun.  \\\\\\\"Oh, yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. \\\\\\\"But we can't follow them now -\\\\\\\"  Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously.  Harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up.  \\\\\\\"Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden Forest . . . .\\\\\\\"  And Ron looked even unhappier about that.  At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot.  \\\\\\\"We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,\\\\\\\" Harry told Ron. \\\\\\\"We can take Fang with us. He's used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some help.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Right,\\\\\\\" said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers. \\\\\\\"Er - aren't there - aren't there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?\\\\\\\" he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart's classroom.  Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \\\\\\\"There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns ...  Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.  Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant.\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"Come now,\\\\\\\" he cried, beaming around him. \\\\\\\"Why all these long faces?\\\\\\\"  People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.  \\\\\\\"Don't you people realize,\\\\\\\" said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, \\\\\\\"the danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Says who?\\\\\\\" said Dean Thomas loudly.  \\\\\\\"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken Hagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,\\\\\\\" said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two.  \\\\\\\"Oh, yes he would,\\\\\\\" said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.  \\\\\\\"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid's arrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,\\\\\\\" said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone.  Ron started to say that he didn't think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.  \\\\\\\"We weren't there, remember?\\\\\\\" Harry muttered.  But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face. Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight.  Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded.  The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had no -\\u00a0  where else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight.  Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione's usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.  Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole.  It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.  \\\\\\\"'Course,\\\\\\\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, \\\\\\\"we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Those spiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but. . .\\\\\\\"  His voice trailed away hopefully.  They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.  Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.\\u00a0  \\\\\\\"Come on, Fang, we're going for a walk,\\\\\\\" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.  Harry took out his wand, murmured, \\\\\\\"Lumos!\\\\\\\" and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders.  \\\\\\\"Good thinking,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Id light mine, too, but you know - it'd probably blow up or something ......  Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.  \\\\\\\"Okay,\\\\\\\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \\\\\\\"I'm ready. Let's go.\\\\\\\"  So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry's wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.  Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of *light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.\\u00a0  Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward, crushing Rods foot, but it was only Fang's nose.  \\\\\\\"What d'you reckon?\\\\\\\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.  \\\\\\\"We've come this far,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.  They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever.  Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins.  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry's elbow very hard.  \\\\\\\"There's something moving over there,\\\\\\\" Harry breathed. \\\\\\\"Listen ... sounds like something big ......  They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.  \\\\\\\"Oh, no,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Oh, no, oh, no, oh -\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Shut up,\\\\\\\" said Harry frantically. \\\\\\\"It'll hear you.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Hear me?\\\\\\\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \\\\\\\"It's already heard Fang!\\\\\\\"  The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they\\u00a0\\\"\",\n          \"As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the middle of Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by anyone in the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve itself. The muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen.And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear cloaks in this heat.The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking disappointed.On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and disappointed.Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. Shutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand.The usual low whisper of \\\\Severus Snape\\\\\\\" greeted him, the chill wind swept him, and his tongue rolled up for a moment.\\\\\\\"I didn't kill you,\\\\\\\" he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, \\\\\\\"I've got news, and you won't like it.\\\\\\\"The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone; Copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically different than the house-elf who now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as clean and fluffy as cotton wool, Regulus's locket bouncing on his thin chest.\\\\\\\"Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,\\\\\\\" croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall, beside a number of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered.\\\\\\\"What's happened?\\\\\\\" Ron asked apprehensively. He are Hermione had been pouring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment.A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that read:SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMEDAS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER\\\\\\\"No!\\\\\\\" said Ron and Hermione loudly.Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud.\\\\\\\"Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" 'I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values \\u00a8C' Like committing murder and cutting off people's ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore's study \\u00a8C Merlin's pants!\\\\\\\" she shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, \\\\\\\"I'll be back in a minute!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"'Merlin's pants'?\\\\\\\" repeated Ron, looking amused. \\\\\\\"She must be upset.\\\\\\\" He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape.\\\\\\\"The other teachers won't stand for this, McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won't accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Death Eaters,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it's all friends together. And,\\\\\\\" Harry went on bitterly, drawing up a chair, \\\\\\\"I can't see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape, it'll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Azkaban \\u00a8C and that's if they're lucky. I reckon they'll stay to try and protect the students.\\\\\\\"Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large curcen in his hands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so.\\\\\\\"Thanks, Kreacher,\\\\\\\" said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape's face. \\\\\\\"Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.\\\\\\\"He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher's cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus's locket: Today's French onion was as good as Harry had ever tasted.\\\\\\\"There are still a load of Death Eaters watching this house,\\\\\\\" he told Ron as he ate, \\\\\\\"more than usual. It's like they're hoping we'll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express.\\\\\\\"Ron glanced at his watch.\\\\\\\"I've been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn't it?\\\\\\\"In his mind's eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape's new regime.\\\\\\\"They nearly saw me coming back in just now,\\\\\\\" Harry said, \\\\\\\"I landed badly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I do that every time. Oh, here she is,\\\\\\\" Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen. \\\\\\\"And what in the name of Merlin's most baggy Y Fronts was that about?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I remembered this,\\\\\\\" Hermione panted.She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting inside and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much ease, into the bag's capacious depths.\\\\\\\"Phineas Nigellus,\\\\\\\" Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash.\\\\\\\"Sorry?\\\\\\\" said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to travel between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster's office at Hogwarts: the circular cower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore's collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it ad been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor.\\\\\\\"Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,\\\\\\\" Hermione explained to Ron as she resumed her seat. \\\\\\\"But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Good thinking!\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking impressed.\\\\\\\"Thank you,\\\\\\\" smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her. \\\\\\\"So, Harry, what else happened today?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Nothing,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign of her. Saw your dad though, Ron. He looks fine.\\\\\\\"Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. The had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious.\\\\\\\"Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,\\\\\\\" Ron said. \\\\\\\"That's why we haven't seen Umbridge, she'd never walk, she'd think she's too important.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?\\\\\\\" Hermione asked.\\\\\\\"Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,\\\\\\\" said Ron.\\\\\\\"How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?\\\\\\\" Hermione asked, her soupspoon suspended in midair.\\\\\\\"Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But you never told us that!\\\\\\\"Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen.\\\\\\\"There's nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!\\\\\\\" she said, flipping feverishly through the pages.\\\\\\\"Well, does it really matter?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Ron, it all matters! If we're going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when they're bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! We've been over and over this, I mean, what's the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren't even bothering to tell us \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You do realize, don't you, that there's probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I think we should do it tomorrow,\\\\\\\" said Harry.Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup.\\\\\\\"Tomorrow?\\\\\\\" repeated Hermione. \\\\\\\"You aren't serious, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I am,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I don't think we're going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther away that locket could be. There's already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn't open.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Unless,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"she's found a way of opening it and she's now possessed.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Wouldn't make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place,\\\\\\\" Harry shrugged.Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought.\\\\\\\"We know everything important,\\\\\\\" Harry went on, addressing Hermione. \\\\\\\"We know they've stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry; We know only the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge's office is, because of what you heard the bearded bloke saying to his mate \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"'I'll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,'\\\\\\\" Hermione recited immediately.\\\\\\\"Exactly,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But we haven't got any!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"If the plan works, we will have,\\\\\\\" Harry continued calmly.\\\\\\\"I don't know, Harry, I don't know ... There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance ...\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"That'll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"It's time to act.\\\\\\\"He could tell from Ron's and Hermione's faces that they were scared; he was not particularly confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation.They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations, and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the same time every day. Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of somebody's briefcase. Slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione.\\\\\\\"All right,\\\\\\\" said Ron slowly, \\\\\\\"let's say we go for it tomorrow ... I think it should just be me and Harry.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Oh, don't start that again!\\\\\\\" sighed Hermione. \\\\\\\"I thought we'd settled this.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"It's one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different. Hermione,\\\\\\\" Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously. \\\\\\\"You're on the list of Muggle-borns who didn't present themselves for interrogation!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"And you're supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If anyone shouldn't go, it's Harry, he's got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Fine, I'll stay here,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won't you?\\\\\\\"As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry's forehead. His hand jumped to it. He saw Hermione's eyes narrow, and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair out of his eyes.\\\\\\\"Well, if all three of us go we'll have to Disapparate separately,\\\\\\\" Ron was saying. \\\\\\\"We can't all fit under the Cloak anymore.\\\\\\\"Harry's scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, Kreacher hurried forward.\\\\\\\"Master has not finished his soup, would master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Thanks, Kreacher, but I'll be back in a minute \\u00a8C er \\u00a8C bathroom.\\\\\\\"Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again. Grunting with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes ....He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him had high, timbered gables; they looked like gingerbread houses. He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a mounting excitement ...The door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into Harry's face: humor gone, terror replacing it ....\\\\\\\"Gregorovitch?\\\\\\\" said a high, cold voice.She shook her head: She was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, prevented her shutting him out ...\\\\\\\"I want Gregorovitch.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!\\\\\\\" she cried, shaking her head. \\\\\\\"He no live here! He no live here! I know him not!\\\\\\\"Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark hall, and Harry followed, gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand.\\\\\\\"Where is he?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Das wei&szlig; ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!\\\\\\\"He raised his hand. She screamed. Two young children came running into the hall. She tried to shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green light \\u00a8C\\\\\\\"Harry! HARRY!\\\\\\\"He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was pounding on the door again.\\\\\\\"Harry, open up!\\\\\\\"He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom.\\\\\\\"What were you doing?\\\\\\\" asked Hermione sternly.\\\\\\\"What d'you think I was doing?\\\\\\\" asked Harry with feeble bravado.\\\\\\\"You were yelling your head off!\\\\\\\" said Ron.\\\\\\\"Oh yeah ... I must've dozed off or \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Harry, please don't insult our intelligence,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, taking deep breaths. \\\\\\\"We know your scar hurt downstairs, and you're white as a sheet.\\\\\\\"Harry sat down on the edge of the bath.\\\\\\\"Fine. I've just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he's probably killed her whole family. And he didn't need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there ...\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Harry, you aren't supposed to let this happen anymore!\\\\\\\" Hermione cried, her voice echoing through the bathroom. \\\\\\\"Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! HE thought the connection was dangerous \\u00a8C Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how can it help?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Because it means I know what he's doing,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\\\\\\"So you're not even going to try to shut him out?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hermione, I can't. You know I'm lousy at Occlumency. I never got the hang of it.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You never really tried!\\\\\\\" she said hotly. \\\\\\\"I don't get it, Harry \\u00a8C do you like having this special connection or relationship or what \\u00a8C whatever \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up.\\\\\\\"Like it?\\\\\\\" he said quietly. \\\\\\\"Would you like it?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I \\u00a8C no \\u00a8C I'm sorry, Harry. I just didn't mean \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he's most dangerous. But I'm going to use it.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Dumbledore \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else's. I want to know why he's after Gregorovitch.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Who?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"He's a foreign wandmaker,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"He made Krum's wand and Krum reckons he's brilliant.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But according to you,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"Voldemort's got Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he's already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better ... or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me, because Ollivander didn't know.\\\\\\\"Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back.\\\\\\\"Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, \\\\\\\"but you made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Because I know it wasn't me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really happened!\\\\\\\"They glared at each other; Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments, against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was permitting himself to see into Voldemort's mind. To his relief, Ron intervened.\\\\\\\"Drop it,\\\\\\\" he advised her. \\\\\\\"It's up to him. And if we're going to the Ministry tomorrow, don't you reckon we should go over the plan?\\\\\\\"Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest, though Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the basement kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart.They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and over their plan until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other. Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius's room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for another ten minutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort sought him so determinedly.Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.\\\\\\\"You look terrible,\\\\\\\" was Ron's greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry.\\\\\\\"Not for long,\\\\\\\" said Harry, yawning.They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam review.\\\\\\\"Robes,\\\\\\\" she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, \\\\\\\"Polyjuice Potion ... Invisibility Cloak ... Decoy Detonators ... You should each take a couple just in case ... Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Norgat, Extendable Ears ...\\\\\\\"They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them out and promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when they returned.\\\\\\\"Bless him,\\\\\\\" said Ron fondly, \\\\\\\"and when you think I used to fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.\\\\\\\"They made their way onto the front step with immense caution. They could see a couple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square.Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry.After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, except for a couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not usually appear here until at least eight o'clock.\\\\\\\"Right then,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, checking her watch. \\\\\\\"she ought to be here in about five minutes. When I've Stunned her \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hermione, we know,\\\\\\\" said Ron sternly. \\\\\\\"And I thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here?\\\\\\\"Hermione squealed.\\\\\\\"I nearly forgot! Stand back \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door beside them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from their careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make it look as thought it was still closed.\\\\\\\"And now,\\\\\\\" she said, turning, back to face the other two in the alleyway, \\\\\\\"we put on the Cloak again \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\" \\u00a8C and we wait,\\\\\\\" Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione's head like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry.Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness: the sun had just come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, before Hermione's silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over.\\\\\\\"Nicely done, Hermione,\\\\\\\" said Ron, emerging behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch's head and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch's handbag.\\\\\\\"She's Mafalda Hopkirk,\\\\\\\" he said, reading a small card that identified their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. \\\\\\\"You'd better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens.\\\\\\\"He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M. which he had taken from the witch's purse.Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, and within seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda's spectacles and put them on, Harry checked his watch.\\\\\\\"We're running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.\\\\\\\"They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop, and a small, ferrety looking wizard appeared before them.\\\\\\\"Oh, hello, Mafalda.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Hello!\\\\\\\" said Hermione in a quavery voice, \\\\\\\"How are you today?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Not so good, actually,\\\\\\\" replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly downcast.As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along behind them.\\\\\\\"I'm sorry to hear you're under the weather,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, talking firmly over the little wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the street. \\\\\\\"Here, have a sweet.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Eh? Oh, no thanks \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"I insist!\\\\\\\" said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one.The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top of his head.\\\\\\\"Oh dear!\\\\\\\" she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. \\\\\\\"Perhaps you'd better take the day off!\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"No \\u00a8C no!\\\\\\\" He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk straight. \\\\\\\"I must \\u00a8C today \\u00a8C must go \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"But that's just silly!\\\\\\\" said Hermione, alarmed. \\\\\\\"You can't go to work in this state \\u00a8C I think you ought to go to St. Mungo's and get them to sort you out.\\\\\\\"The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the main street.\\\\\\\"You simply can't go to work like this!\\\\\\\" cried Hermione.At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a reposed Hermione to claw his way back into a standing position, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit.\\\\\\\"Urgh,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, holding up the skirt of her robe to avoid the puddles of sick. \\\\\\\"It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard's bag, \\\\\\\"but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn't he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.\\\\\\\"Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag.\\\\\\\"Weird he wasn't wearing them today, wasn't it, seeing how much he wanted to go? Anyway, I'm Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Now wait here,\\\\\\\" Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, \\\\\\\"and we'll be back with some hairs for you.\\\\\\\"He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in the sick-splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione reappeared.\\\\\\\"We don't know who he is,\\\\\\\" Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black hairs, \\\\\\\"but he's gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he's pretty tall, you'll need bigger robes ...\\\\\\\"She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take the potion and change.Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two.\\\\\\\"Blimey, that's scary,\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him.\\\\\\\"Take one of Mafalda's tokens,\\\\\\\" Hermione told Harry, \\\\\\\"and let's go, it's nearly nine.\\\\\\\"They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs, one labeled GENTLEMEN, the other LADIES.\\\\\\\"See you in a moment, then,\\\\\\\" said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white.\\\\\\\"Morning, Reg!\\\\\\\" called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. \\\\\\\"Blooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?\\\\\\\"The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle.\\\\\\\"Yeah,\\\\\\\" he said, \\\\\\\"stupid, isn't it?\\\\\\\"And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles.To Harry's left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him.\\\\\\\"We have to flush ourselves in?\\\\\\\" he whispered.\\\\\\\"Looks like it,\\\\\\\" Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly.They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet.He knew at once that he had done the right thing; thought he appeared to be standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into the Ministry of Magic.He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain had filled the center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was rather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT.Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs. Another wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him.\\\\\\\"Out of the way, can't y \\u00a8C oh, sorry, Runcorn.\\\\\\\"Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man who Harry was impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating.\\\\\\\"Psst!\\\\\\\" said a voice, and he looked around to see a whispy little witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join them.\\\\\\\"You got in all right, then?\\\\\\\" Hermione whispered to Harry.\\\\\\\"No, he's still stuck in the hog,\\\\\\\" said Ron.\\\\\\\"Oh, very funny ... It's horrible, isn't it?\\\\\\\" she said to Harry, who was staring up at the statue. \\\\\\\"Have you seen what they're sitting on?\\\\\\\"Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved humans: hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, women, and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards.\\\\\\\"Muggles,\\\\\\\" whispered Hermione, \\\\\\\"In their rightful place. Come on, let's get going.\\\\\\\"They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when a voice said, \\\\\\\"Cattermole!\\\\\\\"They looked around: Harry's stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledore's death was striding toward them. The Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them.The man's scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with much gold thread. Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically, \\\\\\\"Morning, Yaxley!\\\\\\\" Yaxley ignored them.\\\\\\\"I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, Cattermole. It's still raining in there.\\\\\\\"Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody spoke.\\\\\\\"Raining ... in your office? That's \\u00a8C that's not good, is it?\\\\\\\"Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley's eyes widened.\\\\\\\"You think it's funny, Cattermole, do you?\\\\\\\"A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off.\\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"no, of course \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I'm quite surprised you're not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.\\\\\\\"Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She cough feebly and turned away.\\\\\\\"I \\u00a8C I \\u00a8C \\\\\\\" stammered Ron.\\\\\\\"But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,\\\\\\\" said Yaxley, \\\\\\\" \\u00a8C not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth \\u00a8C and the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do this job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" whispered Ron.\\\\\\\"Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an hour, your wife's Blood Status will be in even greater doubt than it is now.\\\\\\\"The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward.\\\\\\\"What am I going to do?\\\\\\\" Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. \\\\\\\"If I don't turn up, my wife ... I mean, Cattermole's wife \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"We'll come with you, we should stick together \\u00a8C \\\\\\\" began Harry, but Ron shook his head feverishly.\\\\\\\"That's mental, we haven't got much time. You two find Umbridge, I'll go and sort out Yaxley's office \\u00a8C but how do I stop a raining?\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Try Finite Incantatem,\\\\\\\" said Hermione at once, \\\\\\\"that should stop the rain if it's a hex or curse; if it doesn't something's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings \\u00a8C \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"Say it again, slowly \\u00a8C \\\\\\\" said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, \\\\\\\"Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau,\\\\\\\" and the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.\\\\\\\"Morning, Albert,\\\\\\\" said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He glanced over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more; Hermione was now whispering frantic instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttering \\\\\\\"Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I'm pretty confident I'll get his job now!\\\\\\\"He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice.

            "\"“There was once a little Kid whose growing horns made him think he was a grown-up Billy Goat and able to take care of himself. So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the flock was gone. He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf. Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf! The Kid knew there was little hope for him. \\“Please, Mr. Wolf,\\” he said trembling, \\“I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can.\\“The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily. Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade.\"\"\",Do not let anything turn you from your purpose.,THE WOLF AND THE KID,EP1,1.0\n",
            "\"“The Tortoise, you know, carries his house on his back. No matter how hard he tries, he cannot leave home. They say that Jupiter punished him so, because he was such a lazy stay-at-home that he would not go to Jupiter's wedding, even when especially invited. After many years, Tortoise began to wish he had gone to that wedding. When he saw how gaily the birds flew about and how the Hare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by, always eager to see everything there was to be seen, the Tortoise felt very sad and discontented. He wanted to see the world too, and there he was with a house on his back and little short legs that could hardly drag him along. One day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble. \\“We can help you to see the world,\\” said the Ducks. \\“Take hold of this stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or you will be sorry.\\“ The Tortoise was very glad indeed. He seized the stick firmly with his teeth, the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end, and away they sailed up toward the clouds. Just then a Crow flew by. He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried: \\“This must surely be the King of Tortoises!\\“ \\“Why certainly—\\“ began the Tortoise. But as he opened his mouth to say these foolish words he lost his hold on the stick, and down he fell to the ground, where he was dashed to pieces on a rock.\"\"\",\"Foolish curiosity and vanity often lead to misfortune.”@THE TORTOISE AND THE DUCKS\"\"\",EP2,1,\n",
